    "When working on a data science project (as in any project) we don't want to be thinking all the time about the low level details of data loading, manipulation visualisation. In the same way we don't care about what the actual machine instructions being executed by the hardware are or the eact memory address of our data, we don't want to think about low-level loops and conditionals. We want to think at higher a level about the operations on our data as they relate to the problem we are trying to solve. To achieve this, instead of working with the low-level operations as we have seen so far, we will start using a **data model**."
